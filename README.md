# ldap_audit_log_analysis
 
In the "Performance Tuning for IBM Security Directory Server" IBM Redbook (https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/redp4258.html?Open) there is an "itdsaudit.jar" file that provides some useful statistics on what is in the audit log. 
Using a decompiler I was able to look into the jar and it's classes and see what the code does, but I'm not that big on Java, I wanted something in Python.
This is the result. Does everything the original jar does and more.
